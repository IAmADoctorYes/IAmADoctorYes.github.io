<p>An argument for urbanism</p>
<p>I began my life at Shepherd as a student for two semesters before
moving off campus so I can speak for both sides when I say that it feels
almost impossible to walk anywhere on campus without gearing up for a
hike. Sure, I like parking closer to my classes, but ideally, I should
be able to park across campus and walk or bike across in a reasonable
time with relative comfort and safety. Let’s say I have a disability and
the parking spaces downtown are all taken so I have to park at Potomac
and walk through the underpass to get to class. It’s not a huge and
unmanageable distance, but there’s very little accommodation for those
with disabilities to safely and comfortably get to campus due to the
significant inclines and declines. I understand that hill grades may not
be a big deal for most people, but for those with disabilities, they can
literally prevent them from getting places safely, comfortably, and on
time without driving directly there. Thankfully, some of this is being
addressed in Shepherd University’s current master plan.</p>
<p>Shepherd University's master plan outlines the university's
objectives and goals for campus development, proposing a ten-year
implementation path that identifies new facilities to address near and
long-term goals while acknowledging the value of the campus's historic
buildings. The university's location on the Potomac River in a historic
community within close proximity to Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia,
and Washington D.C. provides a unique opportunity for campus development
that takes into account its unique location and history while addressing
its near and long-term goals. Overall, Shepherd University's master plan
provides a framework for future campus development that takes into
account its unique location and history while also addressing its near
and long-term goals.</p>
<p>On page 14 of the master plan, it is shown that while there is
technically sufficient parking overall for students and faculty, the
east campus contains a slim minority of the parking. This causes issues
when commuters and faculty who do not live on campus prefer parking
closer to the buildings they are working or going to classes in. Many
may say that the solution to this would be to increase parking on the
east side of campus, and while that may help somewhat, I argue that
increasing campus accessibility and foot traffic is much more important
than an increase in parking because it would decrease the need for motor
vehicles in and around campus by encouraging more bike use as well as
allowing all on-campus students to safely get to class without a vehicle
even in adverse conditions.</p>
<p>Shepherd University is located in historic Shepherdstown, West
Virginia, and is neatly tucked one block behind downtown German Street.
Because of this, the University has a unique opportunity to create a
more pedestrian-friendly campus by increasing pedestrianization and
reducing the emphasis on parking. One of the key benefits of increased
pedestrianization is that it can create a more welcoming and attractive
campus environment. This would not only benefit current students,
faculty, and staff but also attract prospective students and visitors to
the University. In contrast, increasing parking on campus would not have
the same positive impact on campus aesthetics. Parking lots take up
valuable space that could be used for green spaces or other amenities
that enhance campus life. Additionally, large parking lots can create
heat islands and contribute to stormwater runoff problems.</p>
<p>But, while locals may walk around every day to their local cafes,
jobs, and parks, this is not a realistic vision for many of Shepherd’s
commuters who make up around 69% of the student as of 2022
(https://www.shepherd.edu/quick-facts/), not to mention the amount of
staff who drive to campus. Commuters typically live off campus and
commute to campus, a majority by driving unless they live near the
downtown area (I say this because I’m still in Shepherdstown technically
but it would be extremely unsafe for me to walk that distance down
Martinsburg pike, let alone the street I live on). Because of this,
putting funds into increasing walkability could be seen as a waste of
resources when they could be spent demolishing unsafe buildings and
putting new parking in for those who require it. However, these concerns
can be addressed by implementing alternative transportation options such
as shuttle services or bike-sharing programs. Additionally, creating
more walkable and bikeable routes to campus can encourage more people to
choose active transportation modes instead of driving. As Jane Jacobs
wrote in “The Death and Life of Great American Cities,” “There is a
quality even meaner than outright ugliness or disorder, and this meaner
quality is the dishonest mask of pretended order, achieved by ignoring
or suppressing the real order that is struggling to exist and to be
served” (Jacobs). By considering the needs and desires of all members of
the community, including commuters and staff, we can create a more
inclusive and sustainable transportation system.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it is important to consider the long-term benefits of
investing in sustainable transportation options. While it may seem more
practical in the short term to focus on increasing car access and
parking availability, this approach is not sustainable in the long run.
By prioritizing walkability, bikeability, and public transportation,
Shepherdstown can reduce its carbon footprint and improve the overall
quality of life for its residents and visitors. This approach aligns
with Jane Jacobs’ belief that “We expect too much of new buildings, and
too little of ourselves” (Jacobs). By taking responsibility for our own
actions and making conscious choices about how we move around our
community, we can create a more sustainable and livable future.</p>
<p>Also included in the master plan was a new dining hall and multiple
residence halls, these were thought to provide a large boost to the
student population, but due to the pandemic and the closing of other
residence halls, Fall enrollment and head counts have stagnated and even
declined in recent years. It would be important to note that an increase
in students would require an increase in sufficient amenities to
accommodate the larger population. The Plan mentions a new student
center on the east campus to ease this issue, as well as attaching a
parking garage to it for increased parking for commuters and faculty.
Other changes, though, would have a much more drastic effect on not only
campus design but community culture. For example, the pedestrianization
of King Street.</p>
<p>The pedestrianization of King Street would be a major change to the
Shepherd campus and a needed one at that. King Street is extremely steep
and hostile to pedestrians. The street within the university grounds
could be much better served as a communal walking space to host events
and encourage student involvement. Another benefit of increased
pedestrianization is improved safety for pedestrians. By reducing
vehicle traffic on campus, there would be fewer conflicts between
vehicles and pedestrians. This would make it safer for students,
faculty, staff, and visitors to walk or bike around campus. Hopefully,
this new footpath would also include stairs down to the river, as that
has been needed by the community for many years now. The only
alternative routes down to the river trail are streets with no sidewalks
and for some, it's essential to drive purely for your own safety.</p>
<p>Another priority stated in the master plan is the strengthening of
campus identity. As far as campus identity goes, I feel like it’s pretty
clear that we’re here, however, I will admit that Shepherdstown itself
has a very strong brand, so the university could probably use some
stronger branding of its own. A solution to this would be the creation
of a new gateway to the East Campus and the pedestrianization of King
Street as they would both enhance the overall aesthetic appeal of the
campus (Shepherd University - King Street Pedestrian &amp; Streetscape
Improvements · Design Collective). The addition of a parking garage, in
contrast, is somewhat gross in my eyes because of all the nearby
greenery. However, on the map on page 25 of the master plan it seems to
be hidden well by the proposed student center which would be highly
beneficial. As Turner notes, “colleges with less areas to build on,
sometimes structure their buildings around vertical, rather than a
horizontal social space” (291). By utilizing vertical space and
carefully considering the placement of new buildings, Shepherd
University can enhance its campus identity while preserving its natural
beauty.</p>
<p>In writing this essay, I carefully considered the sources of evidence
that would best support my arguments and claims about increasing
urbanization in Shepherdstown. To gather evidence, I turned to a variety
of sources, including books by renowned urban theorists such as Jane
Jacobs and Miles Orvell, as well as campus planning documents from
Shepherd University and other institutions. I also consulted the
Shepherd University website for up-to-date information about the
university’s plans and initiatives. By drawing on a diverse range of
sources, I was able to gather strong evidence to support my arguments
and provide a well-rounded perspective on the topic.</p>
<p>In conclusion, increasing pedestrianization on Shepherd University’s
Campus should be prioritized over increasing parking. A more
pedestrian-friendly campus would enhance its aesthetic appeal and
improve safety for pedestrians. In contrast, large parking lots can
detract from campus aesthetics and contribute to environmental problems.
By focusing on creating a more welcoming and attractive campus
environment through increased pedestrianization, Shepherd University can
enhance the overall campus experience for students, faculty, staff, and
visitors.</p>
