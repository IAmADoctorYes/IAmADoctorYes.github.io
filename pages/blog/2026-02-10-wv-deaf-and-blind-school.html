<p>If you were to imagine a handicapped person, what is the first thing
that would come to your mind? Most likely a person in a wheelchair, an
amputee, or somebody who is blind. But it is almost guaranteed that your
first thought was not a deaf or HOH(hard of hearing) person. Those who
are deaf are not just handicapped because they can not hear, but because
they are also socially handicapped. Sure, they can contribute their
thoughts on social media and text others, but when it comes to real-life
one-on-one interaction, they are highly restricted. Whether it be asking
for directions or ordering at a fast food place, the problems of these
completely legitimate members of society are overlooked by the general
public every day.</p>
<p>Recently, Starbucks opened up its first deaf-friendly outlet in
Washington D.C. The cafe offers diagrams and other sorts of media in
order to assist in the ordering process and to teach some sign language
to those who are interested. While this is a step in the right
direction, there are still almost no deaf-friendly businesses anywhere
in the US. As a result of this, deaf restaurant patrons are regularly
forced to deal with impatience from staff, use cell phones to
communicate with waiters, have people raise their voices at them, and
other inconveniences.</p>
<p>The first step to fixing these issues would be to educate people on
how to deal with those who possess different handicaps, whether it be
deafness, blindness, or otherwise. After that, the solutions vary from
teaching more sign language in all public schools or having laws that
require businesses to be more inclusive to deaf people.</p>
<p>And, of course, one would be left to incompleteness if the West
Virginia Schools for the Deaf and Blind were not mentioned. Or, rather,
the one school for the deaf and blind. The West Virginia School for the
Deaf and Blind (and the only school for the deaf and blind) has
extremely outdated facilities dating back to 1938. Though many attempts
have been made to fund improvements and repairs, the local school board
has absolutely, “no interest,” in funding the projects. The improvements
include HVAC systems, roofing, and other projects that need to be fixed
in order to bring the school back up to <mark>federal and state
standards, but at the moment, this lack of funding and renovations poses
a terrible health and safety risk to those who attend.</mark></p>
<p>Those with disabilities go through so much every day just because of
how they are born. And now is the time to take their education seriously
and to put a stop to discrimination. Those in positions of power must
start to make changes to give these humans, these Americans, and these
West Virginians a chance to live as who they are and give them equal
opportunities. Change is not always easy, but I think that we are up for
it. Even if it means learning to fingerspell.</p>
