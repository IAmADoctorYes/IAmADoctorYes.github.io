An example of this is when Cenk Uygur commented on Hannibal Burress bringing up Bill Cosby’s rape allegations of the time saying, “He’s a comedian, so I think that there’s a legitimate discussion to be had about whether or not a comedian should be able to use words like rapist when you’re dealing with someone who hasn’t been convicted of rape” (3:16). There is an ongoing discussion on where the line is and whether the person at question's background matters because jokes can very easily be taken out of context when distributed on the internet. Some people, like Ian Crouch in his article, Is Social Media Ruining Comedy points out that uncensored speech is inherent in a comedian’s job saying that, “In order to be meaningful, to transcend the hacky and inane, comedians have to say things that other people are afraid to say” (123). Others, like Rebecca Krefting in her article, “political correctness isn’t killing comedy, it’s making it better” state that the censorship of hate speech and micro-aggressive language makes the popular comedy scene exclusive to non-minorities, and that this new era of comedy will be better for everyone, saying that, “Despite all the challenges to the status quo in comedy, none of this core has gone away. The changes we’re seeing aren’t killing comedy. They’re just letting more people in on the jokes.” It's important to note that audiences generally come to see specific comedian's shows and know what to expect from them, and the comedian feels the need to live up to the audience's view of them to support their career It is my belief that while free speech is important in many circumstances;however, it is equally important to not give hate speech a platform where there is pressure to tolerate it, such as a comedy show. </span></p><p style='padding:0;margin:0;color:#000000;font-size:11pt;font-family:"Arial";line-height:2.0;orphans:2;widows:2;text-align:left'><span style='color:#000000;font-weight:400;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;font-size:12pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";font-style:normal'>It's extremely difficult to gauge where "too far" is when it comes to jokes due to different communities having different senses of humor, and a joke that may be extremely funny in one social sphere may be absolutely offensive in another. Jokes about subjects such as race, the LGBT community, or sometimes even rape are regarded as extremely controversial in today’s society due to an emerging culture of political correctness. Due to these changes in the status quo of comedy, it is important to be mindful to not offend or trigger those in your audience or, if you do, clarify yourself or apologize (though, of course, it is not always going to be the comedian’s fault). Sometimes though, jokes can be taken completely out of context, as eloquently stated by Crouch, “Something said in front of a small crowd a few drinks deep in the middle of the night can easily be shared with a sober mass of people sitting upright in their chairs browsing the internet the next day” (122). Also, it is important to note that comedian generally has more freedom to speak about issues and such that the normal person does not, as stated by Uygur, “He’s a comedian, is calling Cosby a rapist too far? No question it’s too far in any other context. [...] But as a comedian do you get to make jokes? Yeah, of course you do dude! Is he going too far with the jokes? Then we’re getting into the comedy police which I hate”(4:40). So where is too far? At what point does humor go bad? In my eyes, and the eyes of many, that point is where said comedy enforces harmful stereotypes to a certain group of people, especially if it goes to the extent of that group of people becoming oppressed. And if the comedian is under the influence, then that should be taken into account as well as the history of their relationship to the group of people. </span></p><p style='padding:0;margin:0;color:#000000;font-size:11pt;font-family:"Arial";line-height:2.0;orphans:2;widows:2;text-align:left'><span style='color:#000000;font-weight:400;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;font-size:12pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";font-style:normal'>However, not all people believe that hate speech and speech akin to it should be kept out of comedy and performance. It's not something that people will directly admit, however, as those who don't believe in censorship of hate speech typically cannot recognize it, and generally don't mean to hurt or offend communities. Despite this, people like Krefting have noted that “While some among the anti-PC ranks are comics of color, like Chris Rock and Russell Peters, and a few are women, like Lisa Lampanelli, queen of shock comedy, those most vocal about this are, by and large, straight white male comics” Given this insight paired with the history of white male comedians getting in trouble for what they’ve said about different minority groups outside of their shows, we can conclude that hate speech is not accepted outside of comedy, and that a majority of anti-PC comedians (white anti-political-correctness comedians) are only vocal about PC culture so that they can continue joking about and making fun of minority groups. Of course, this is not acceptable, for there are tons of other subjects to joke about that don’t harm minority groups through discriminatory stereotypes. Thankfully, this is not an unpopular take! </span></p><p style='padding:0;margin:0;color:#000000;font-size:11pt;font-family:"Arial";line-height:2.0;orphans:2;widows:2;text-align:left'><span style='color:#000000;font-weight:400;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;font-size:12pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";font-style:normal'>As comedy has become a more widespread form of entertainment, people throughout the world have started to take comedy more seriously. This is because, as said by Borum Chatoo, “Comedy’s prominent role and popularity in the dominant system of popular culture - the shred location where we absorb the majority of our beliefs, ideologies, and cultural narratives - provides its central position of influence” (Chatoo 12). Comedy has always depended on the culture of the times, Nancy Goldman states this saying that, “Comedy operates on an understanding of our shared social norms and customs, national ethos, and our underlying morals” (Page 2). Our culture has become more progressive, inclusive, and advanced; and as a result of this, so too has our sense of humor. </span></p><p style='padding:0;margin:0;color:#000000;font-size:11pt;font-family:"Arial";line-height:2.0;orphans:2;widows:2;text-align:left'><span style='color:#000000;font-weight:400;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;font-size:12pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";font-style:normal'>Our progress as a society culturally has caused lots of backlash in communities with a history of discrimination against others. Things that are meant to be jokes are sometimes analyzed to reveal underlying problems with those who said them, and the culture in which they reside. It is important, however, to not let ourselves be angered by the backlash, and instead understand that they are watching the culture of the world change in a way that does not benefit them, and they are scared. Though racism, sexism, homophobia, etc. are never tolerable, it is only with calm and collected explanations that we can bring everybody along for the ride. Comedians have always been allowed to say whatever they want for the most part, but we as a society are entirely right and just in judging them on stances and statements that are harmful to others. Whether it be a joke that makes less serious the idea of rape or a joke about a minority group, all jokes must be judged based on their content, context, and purpose. And yes, sometimes a joke from the past will be judged too harshly and the comedian with it, but it’s our job as a society to speak out and ensure corrections of behaviors like these either have been made or will be made. As a wise man once said, “an old dog may not be able to learn new tricks, but it can definitely stop promoting hate speech”(me, right now, the funniest person on Earth).</span></p><p style='padding:0;margin:0;color:#000000;font-size:11pt;font-family:"Arial";line-height:2.0;orphans:2;widows:2;height:11pt;text-align:left'><span style='color:#000000;font-weight:400;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;font-size:12pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";font-style:normal'></span></p><p style='padding:0;margin:0;color:#000000;font-size:11pt;font-family:"Arial";line-height:2.0;orphans:2;widows:2;text-align:center'><span style='color:#000000;font-weight:400;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;font-size:12pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";font-style:normal'>Works Cited</span></p><p style='padding:0;color:#000000;font-size:11pt;line-height:2.0;margin-right:0;margin-left:36pt;text-indent:-36pt;font-family:"Arial";margin-top:0;orphans:2;margin-bottom:0;widows:2;text-align:left'><span style='color:#000000;font-weight:400;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;font-size:12pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";font-style:normal'>Borum Chatoo, Caty, and Lauren Feldman.
