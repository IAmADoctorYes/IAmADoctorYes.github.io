<p>Society has changed, now it’s comedy’s turn.</p>
<p>As much as our country touts free speech above all else, there are
obvious points where some may feel that free speech goes too far (as in
cases of providing a platform for misinformation and/or hate speech). An
example of this is when Cenk Uygur commented on Hannibal Burress
bringing up Bill Cosby’s rape allegations of the time saying, “He’s a
comedian, so I think that there’s a legitimate discussion to be had
about whether or not a comedian should be able to use words like rapist
when you’re dealing with someone who hasn’t been convicted of rape”
(3:16). There is an ongoing discussion on where the line is and whether
the person at question's background matters because jokes can very
easily be taken out of context when distributed on the internet. Some
people, like Ian Crouch in his article, Is Social Media Ruining Comedy
points out that uncensored speech is inherent in a comedian’s job saying
that, “In order to be meaningful, to transcend the hacky and inane,
comedians have to say things that other people are afraid to say” (123).
Others, like Rebecca Krefting in her article, “political correctness
isn’t killing comedy, it’s making it better” state that the censorship
of hate speech and micro-aggressive language makes the popular comedy
scene exclusive to non-minorities, and that this new era of comedy will
be better for everyone, saying that, “Despite all the challenges to the
status quo in comedy, none of this core has gone away. The changes we’re
seeing aren’t killing comedy. They’re just letting more people in on the
jokes.” It's important to note that audiences generally come to see
specific comedian's shows and know what to expect from them, and the
comedian feels the need to live up to the audience's view of them to
support their career It is my belief that while free speech is important
in many circumstances;however, it is equally important to not give hate
speech a platform where there is pressure to tolerate it, such as a
comedy show.</p>
<p>It's extremely difficult to gauge where "too far" is when it comes to
jokes due to different communities having different senses of humor, and
a joke that may be extremely funny in one social sphere may be
absolutely offensive in another. Jokes about subjects such as race, the
LGBT community, or sometimes even rape are regarded as extremely
controversial in today’s society due to an emerging culture of political
correctness. Due to these changes in the status quo of comedy, it is
important to be mindful to not offend or trigger those in your audience
or, if you do, clarify yourself or apologize (though, of course, it is
not always going to be the comedian’s fault). Sometimes though, jokes
can be taken completely out of context, as eloquently stated by Crouch,
“Something said in front of a small crowd a few drinks deep in the
middle of the night can easily be shared with a sober mass of people
sitting upright in their chairs browsing the internet the next day”
(122). Also, it is important to note that comedian generally has more
freedom to speak about issues and such that the normal person does not,
as stated by Uygur, “He’s a comedian, is calling Cosby a rapist too far?
No question it’s too far in any other context. [...] But as a comedian
do you get to make jokes? Yeah, of course you do dude! Is he going too
far with the jokes? Then we’re getting into the comedy police which I
hate”(4:40). So where is too far? At what point does humor go bad? In my
eyes, and the eyes of many, that point is where said comedy enforces
harmful stereotypes to a certain group of people, especially if it goes
to the extent of that group of people becoming oppressed. And if the
comedian is under the influence, then that should be taken into account
as well as the history of their relationship to the group of people.</p>
<p>However, not all people believe that hate speech and speech akin to
it should be kept out of comedy and performance. It's not something that
people will directly admit, however, as those who don't believe in
censorship of hate speech typically cannot recognize it, and generally
don't mean to hurt or offend communities. Despite this, people like
Krefting have noted that “While some among the anti-PC ranks are comics
of color, like Chris Rock and Russell Peters, and a few are women, like
Lisa Lampanelli, queen of shock comedy, those most vocal about this are,
by and large, straight white male comics” Given this insight paired with
the history of white male comedians getting in trouble for what they’ve
said about different minority groups outside of their shows, we can
conclude that hate speech is not accepted outside of comedy, and that a
majority of anti-PC comedians (white anti-political-correctness
comedians) are only vocal about PC culture so that they can continue
joking about and making fun of minority groups. Of course, this is not
acceptable, for there are tons of other subjects to joke about that
don’t harm minority groups through discriminatory stereotypes.
Thankfully, this is not an unpopular take!</p>
<p>As comedy has become a more widespread form of entertainment, people
throughout the world have started to take comedy more seriously. This is
because, as said by Borum Chatoo, “Comedy’s prominent role and
popularity in the dominant system of popular culture - the shred
location where we absorb the majority of our beliefs, ideologies, and
cultural narratives - provides its central position of influence”
(Chatoo 12). Comedy has always depended on the culture of the times,
Nancy Goldman states this saying that, “Comedy operates on an
understanding of our shared social norms and customs, national ethos,
and our underlying morals” (Page 2). Our culture has become more
progressive, inclusive, and advanced; and as a result of this, so too
has our sense of humor.</p>
<p>Our progress as a society culturally has caused lots of backlash in
communities with a history of discrimination against others. Things that
are meant to be jokes are sometimes analyzed to reveal underlying
problems with those who said them, and the culture in which they reside.
It is important, however, to not let ourselves be angered by the
backlash, and instead understand that they are watching the culture of
the world change in a way that does not benefit them, and they are
scared. Though racism, sexism, homophobia, etc. are never tolerable, it
is only with calm and collected explanations that we can bring everybody
along for the ride. Comedians have always been allowed to say whatever
they want for the most part, but we as a society are entirely right and
just in judging them on stances and statements that are harmful to
others. Whether it be a joke that makes less serious the idea of rape or
a joke about a minority group, all jokes must be judged based on their
content, context, and purpose. And yes, sometimes a joke from the past
will be judged too harshly and the comedian with it, but it’s our job as
a society to speak out and ensure corrections of behaviors like these
either have been made or will be made. As a wise man once said, “an old
dog may not be able to learn new tricks, but it can definitely stop
promoting hate speech”(me, right now, the funniest person on Earth).</p>
